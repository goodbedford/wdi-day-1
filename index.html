	<h1>Homework 1</h1>
	<h2>Ice Breaker</h2>
	<p> Today is June 22nd 2015 the first day of WDI at GA. I learned a lot about my classmates. I am in cohort 19 and there is another cohort 20 that started today as well. We played a fun ice breaking game where we through a rubber duck around the room and said each others names. It was really funny. We timed ourselves and got to under 30 seconds.
	</p>
	<h2>Web Developer Console</h2>
	<p>We got a preview of the web developers tools for chrome. Cameron suggested that we learn more browsers dev tools besides chrome. Perhaps Firefox. It was interesting observing the different tabs. I learned that the magnifying glass symbol could be used to hover over paper elements and see what the code represenation is.
	</p>
	<h2>Don't Give Up</h2>
	<p>We were given a lot of reading material with the basic underlining theme "Don
	t Give Up". There were tips for junior developers such as read others code and stay positive. There will be a lot of battles and we may lose some but the war is won by those who keep fighting.
