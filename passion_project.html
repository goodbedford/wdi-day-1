	<h2>Family Website</h2>
	<p>I have signed up to take over my family website following my graduatation from GA. The current website is okay but is not on the level I have envisioned. We currently use some stock theme and it doesn't have much functionality. I plan to make it angular and have great animations and transitions. I would like to have that giant image of the connecting nodes of each family member. We have been able to go back to my Great Great Grandparents on my mothers side. I would like the site to be able to have family members go in and update their profiles and add love ones and photos.
